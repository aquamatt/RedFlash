* Allow contact to be a Twitter ID instead of a phone number

* Should we have a status code/message for when any attempt to send a message results
in no recipients getting it on account of all being disabled/erroring?

* Implement delivery confirmation call-back handler

* Allow events to have a custom 'sender number' to be attached...
