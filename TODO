TODO
====
* LOGGING

* Allow contact to be a Twitter ID instead of a phone number
  - see http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/

* Should we have a status code/message for when any attempt to send a message results
in no recipients getting it on account of all being disabled/erroring?

* re-factor gateway

* move clickatel_delivery_status content into the gateway class

* Allow events to have a custom 'sender number' to be attached...

* Little front-end GUI for sending messages manually

* Summarise integration issues/pros/cons with:
** TMC (www.tmcsms.com - looks like cheap virtual numbers, but API is SOAP and
   outbound not so cheap with _from_ 5.9p / msg)
** MessageMedia. Also appear to be SOAP only. Replies flagged to match outbound messages
   which is nice - clickatell can't do that. Pricing not published.
** www.bulksms.co.uk - two-way SMS without needing virtual number. Pricing more expensive
   than clickatell
** www.routomessaging.com - seems to be cheaper than clickatell. Not sure you get delivery
   receipts.
