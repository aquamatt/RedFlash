Outline installation instructions
=================================

Pending more complete documentation the process to install for test and development
is outlined below. Production installation is left to the enthusiastic reader to
work out but the init.d script in ext/redflash_init.d can be used as a template which,
after editing, can be put into /etc/init.d/redflash and used to start the process
under gunicorn (installed in requirements). 

1) Create a directory in which to build a Python virtual environment and create:

 $ mkdir redflash
 $ cd redflash
 $ virtualenv .
 
2) Clone redflash into this directory

3) Install requirements with pip (note that your DBM of choice and Redis or RabbitMQ 
should be installed in advance)

 $ source bin/activate
 $ cd redflash
 $ pip install -E .. -r requirements.txt
 
4) Edit database and SMS gateway details in config/settings.py. For test purposes
   comment out the ClickatellGateway and uncomment the DummyGateway (this is forced
   automatically when the test suite is run)

5) Create the redflash database in your chosen database engine and initialise:

 $ python manage.py syncdb
 $ python manage.py migrate
 
6) Run the server:

 $ python manage.py runserver
 
7) In order to have some data, allbeit rubbish, data (as used by the test-suite):

 $ python manage.py loaddata testdata
 
7) In browser, look at http://localhost:8000/admin and login with the user/pass you 
   created in step 5
   
Local configuration
===================

The file /etc/redflash.py is imported by settings.py at the end so can be used
to override any settings on a per-host basis. You can, for example, put your
Clickatell user and password in there.
   
Testing with the Python client
==============================

In the ext directory you will find redflash.py which contains a Python client wrapper. Put
on your Python path and use as follows:

 from redflash import RedFlashClient
 
 rfc = RedFlashClient(rf_url = 'http://REDFLASH.SERVER.ADDRESS', api_key = 'A KEY FROM THE APIUser MODEL')
 rfc.notify_contact('contact-slug', 'message')
 rfc.notify_group('group-slug', 'message')
 
 # additional key-word arguments are passed into the context used to process
 # the message template associated with the event (see Events in the admin).
 rfc.fire_event('event-slug', **additional_arguments)
